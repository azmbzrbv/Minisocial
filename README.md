# Social-Media Management Console Application

The **Social-Media Management** is a console-based application designed to **simulate the basic functionalities** of popular social-media platforms. The primary goal of the program is to allow users to:

- Create and manage posts
- View posts from other users
- Manage user data

A **file management system** is used to save and control information throughout the program, ensuring data persistence and easy access.
